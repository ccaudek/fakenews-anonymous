#' Locates and remove influential observations (i.e., "outliers") via several
#' distance and/or clustering methods. Given that several methods were selected,
#' we computed a composite outlier score, made of the average of the binary (0
#' or 1) results of each method. Such composite score represents the probability
#' of each observation of being classified as an outlier by at least one method.
#' The decision rule was to classify as outliers observations which composite
#' outlier score was superior or equal to 0.5 (i.e., that were classified as
#' outliers by at least half of the methods). The methods used were:
#' - Cook's Distance: Cook's distance estimates the variations in regression
#'   coefficients after removing each observation, one by one (Cook, 1977).
#' - Pareto: The reliability and approximate convergence of Bayesian models can
#'   be assessed using the estimates for the shape parameter k of the
#'   generalized Pareto distribution. If the estimated tail shape parameter k
#'   exceeds 0.7, the observation was flagged.
#' - IQR: Following Tukey, this method considers as outliers any data point that
#'   falls outside of either 1.5 times the IQR below the first or above the
#'   third quartile.
#' - Z-scores:This univariate method describes a data point as deviance from a
#'   central value, in terms of the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) from the
#'   median. The threshold to classify outliers is 1.959, corresponding to the
#'   2.5 most extreme observations assuming the data is normally distributed.
#' - CI: Another univariate method computing, for each variable, a sort of
#'   "confidence" interval and considering as outliers values lying beyond the
#'   edges of that interval. We considered, as interval, the Bias Corrected and
#'   Accelerated Interval. The threshold was set to 0.95.
#' - Minimum Covariance Determinant: A robust version of Mahalanobis distance.
#'   Leys et al. (2018) argue that Mahalanobis Distance is not a robust way to
#'   determine outliers, as it uses the means and covariances of all the data ‚Äì
#'   including the outliers ‚Äì to determine individual difference scores. Minimum
#'   Covariance Determinant calculates the mean and covariance matrix based on
#'   the most central subset (66%) of the data.
#' - Invariant Coordinate Selection: With PCA, three steps have to be performed:
#'   (i) select the components most useful for the detection, (ii) compute
#'   distances as outlierness measures for all observation, and (iii) label
#'   outliers using a cut-off value derived from simulations (corresponding to
#'   the 2.5% value for outliers classification).
#' - Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm:
#'   The OPTICS algorithm (Ankerst et al., 1999) is an unsupervised clustering
#'   technique used for outliers detection. Compared to the others techniques,
#'   that will always detect several outliers (as these are usually defined as
#'   a percentage of extreme values), this algorithm functions in a different
#'   manner and won't always detect outliers.
#' - Local Outlier Factor: Based on a K nearest neighbours algorithm, LOF
#'   compares the local density of an point to the local densities of its
#'   neighbors instead of computing a distance from the center (Breunig et al.,
#'   2000). Points that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors
#'   are considered outliers. A LOF score of approximately 1 indicates that
#'   density around the point is comparable to its neighbors. Scores
#'   significantly larger than 1 indicate outliers. The default threshold of
#'   0.025 that was used classified as outliers the observations located at
#'   qnorm(1 - 0.025) * SD) of the log-transformed LOF distance.
